Welcome to the ViewBetic Github Repository!

## Our Mission: 

Our mission is to create a system that will not only help users identify whether or not they have Diabetes (or are likely to get it). But also give custom recommendations on what aspects they can improve or change to either prevent it in the future or mitigate it's effects. 

## Meet the Team:
